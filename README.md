# NexGenix_BusinessPortfolio

A clean, responsive landing page for a social media/marketing agency.  
Includes an eye‑catchy **Navbar**, **Hero** (with YouTube embed), **Services**, **Pricing**, **Free Session** lead form, and **Footer**—all styled with Tailwind CSS.

> Designed to be easy to customize: replace images, tweak copy, and adjust arrays (services/pricing) without changing the layout.

---

## ✨ Features

- Sticky, glassy **Navbar** with gradient brand text, animated link underlines, mobile menu, and gradient CTA.
- **Hero** section with dotted-wave background, right‑side glow, and gradient heading.
- **Services** grid with gradient borders, glossy images, clamped titles/descriptions (uniform card heights).
- **Pricing** cards with curved arcs, ribbon accent for the popular plan, and consistent feature lists.
- **Free Session** form: dark gradient card, centered inputs, gradient heading + underline, and a vivid “Back to Homepage” pill.
- **Footer** with newsletter pill, big brand headline, quick links, and social icons.
- Fully responsive (mobile‑first) and accessible (semantic headings, focus styles, larger tap targets).

## 🔧 Customization Guide

Most customizations are a single line change.

### Logo
```jsx
// App.jsx (top)
import myLogo from "./assets/logo.jpg"; // replace with your file in src/assets
```

### Hero — YouTube Video
```jsx
const YOUTUBE_ID = "JBraSNVrueA"; // <- put your own video ID
// Example: https://youtu.be/<ID>
```

### Gradient Headings
- The gradient text utility is reused across sections:
```html
<span class="bg-gradient-to-r from-[#7C3AED] via-[#9F67F4] to-[#EC4899] bg-clip-text text-transparent">...</span>
```
- Underlines use a matching gradient bar right under the heading.

### Services Cards
- Edit the array inside `ServicesSection()`:
```jsx
const services = [{ title, img, desc }, ...]
```
- Titles/descriptions are **clamped** so all cards remain the same height.
  - Change line clamps via `WebkitLineClamp` if you want more/less text.

### Pricing Plans
- Edit the array inside `PricingSection()`:
```jsx
const plans = [{ name, price, currency, period, features: [...] }, ...]
```
- The middle plan can be styled as “Most Popular” by adding a ribbon or scaling (already included in one alternative variant).

### Free Session Form
- Hook the form to your backend/Formspree/etc. in `onSubmit`.
- Inputs are pre‑styled. Add validation as needed.

### Colors
- Change gradients by editing the `from`, `via`, and `to` Tailwind classes.
- Update global background in `<body>` or the root wrapper.
